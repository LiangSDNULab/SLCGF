We present SLCGF, a novel model that integrates soft-label guided contrastive learning with a global feature fusion module. The model first employs Siamese encoders to extract paired feature representations from each omics dataset. Next, it performs contrastive learning both within each view and across views simultaneously, leveraging a neighborhood-based approach to enhance feature discrimination and alignment between different omics. To boost the model's robustness and ensure reliable retention of neighborhood relationships, we treat the affinities between samples and their higher-order neighbors as soft labels, optimizing the contrastive learning process at both levels. Furthermore, SLCGF incorporates a global self-attention mechanism to create a unified feature representation for cancer survival prediction, fully exploiting cross-omics information and adaptively integrating complementary data. Extensive experimental evaluations on 13 multi-omics cancer datasets show that SLCGF outperforms existing methods by a significant margin.<br>
